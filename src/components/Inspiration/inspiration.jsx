              Essential Beauty Tips
            </h3>
            <ul className="space-y-3 list-none text-gray-700">
              <li>
                <strong>Skincare First:</strong> A good skincare routine is the foundation of all beauty. Cleanse, tone, and moisturize twice daily. Use products suited to your skin type and don't skip sunscreen - it's your best defense against premature aging. Consider adding serums and treatments that address your specific concerns like acne, dryness, or fine lines.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Nail Care:</strong> Keep your nails healthy and beautiful with regular maintenance. Moisturize your cuticles daily, file nails in one direction to prevent splitting, and give your nails a break from polish occasionally. Professional manicures and pedicures not only look great but also promote nail health.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hair Maintenance:</strong> Regular trims every 6-8 weeks keep your hair looking fresh and prevent split ends. Use quality shampoos and conditioners suited to your hair type. Avoid excessive heat styling and always use heat protectant products. Deep conditioning treatments once a week can restore moisture and shine.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water for glowing skin. Aim for at least 8 glasses daily. Proper hydration helps maintain skin elasticity, reduces the appearance of fine lines, and gives your complexion a natural radiance. Herbal teas and water-rich foods also contribute to your hydration goals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sleep Well:</strong> Beauty sleep is real! Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. During sleep, your body repairs and regenerates skin cells. Use a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce friction and prevent hair breakage. Establish a bedtime routine that helps you wind down.
